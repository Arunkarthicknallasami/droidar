This small demo demonstrates how an example application using marker detection could look like. 

The expected behavior is as follows:
 * A button appears.
 * When clicked the camera will start and a live preview is seen.
 * If a marker with the ID 0 is detected  a white hexagon will be placed on top of the marker and 3 colored objects will be rotating somewhere around the center of the marker.

This is a very basic example, but the source should explain the general idea of how to use the ARMarkers library in combination with DroidAR.
